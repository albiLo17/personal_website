  abstract: "The field of robotics faces inherent challenges in manipulating deformable objects, particularly in understanding and standardising fabric properties like elasticity, stiffness, and friction. While the significance of these properties is evident in the realm of cloth manipulation, accurately categorising and comprehending them in real-world applications remains elusive. This study sets out to address two primary objectives: (1) to provide a framework suitable for robotics applications to characterise cloth objects,, and (2) to study how these properties influence robotic manipulation tasks. Our preliminary results validate the framework's ability to characterise cloth properties and compare cloth sets, and reveal the influence that different properties have on the outcome of five manipulation primitives. We believe that, in general, results on the manipulation of clothes should be reported along with a better description of the garments used in the evaluation. This paper proposes a set of these measures."

  abstract: "We study the problem of learning graph dynamics of deformable objects which generalize to unknown physical properties. In particular, we leverage a latent representation of elastic physical properties of cloth-like deformable objects which we explore through a pulling interaction. We propose EDO-Net (Elastic Deformable Object - Net), a model trained in a self-supervised fashion on a large variety of samples with different elastic properties. EDO-Net jointly learns an adaptation module, responsible for extracting a latent representation of the physical properties of the object, and a forwarddynamics module, which leverages the latent representation to predict future states of cloth-like objects, represented as graphs. We evaluate EDO-Net both in simulation and real world, assessing its capabilities of: 1) generalizing to unknown physical properties of cloth-like deformable objects, 2) transferring the learned representation to new downstream tasks."

  abstract: "Physical interaction with textiles, such as assistive dressing, relies on advanced dextreous capabilities. The underlying complexity in textile behavior when being pulled and stretched, is due to both the yarn material properties and the textile construction technique. Today, there are no commonly adopted and annotated datasets on which the various interaction or property identification methods are assessed. One important property that affects the interaction is material elasticity that results from both the yarn material and construction technique: these two are intertwined and, if not known a-priori, almost impossible to identify through sensing commonly available on robotic platforms. We introduce Elastic Context (EC), a concept that integrates various properties that affect elastic behavior, to enable a more effective physical interaction with textiles. The definition of EC relies on stress/strain curves commonly used in textile engineering, which we reformulated for robotic applications. We employ EC using Graph Neural Network (GNN) to learn generalized elastic behaviors of textiles. Furthermore, we explore the effect the dimension of the EC has on accurate force modeling of non-linear real-world elastic behaviors, highlighting the challenges of current robotic setups to sense textile properties."

  abstract: "The ability to quickly understand our physical environment and make predictions
          about interacting objects is fundamental to us humans. To equip artificial agents
          with similar reasoning capabilities, machine learning can be used to approximate
          the underlying state dynamics of a system. In this regard, deep learning has gained
          much popularity but is relying on the availability of large-enough datasets. In this
          work, we present DLO@Scale, a new dataset for studying future state prediction
          in the context of multi-body deformable linear object pushing. It contains a
          large collection of 100 million simulated interactions enabling thorough statistical
          analysis and algorithmic benchmarks. Our data is generated using a high-fidelity
          physics engine which simulates complex mechanical phenomena such as elasticity,
          plastic deformation and friction. An important aspect is the large variation of the
          physical parameters making it suitable for testing meta learning algorithms. We
          describe DLO@Scale and present a first empirical evaluation using neural network
          baselines. More information and videos can be found at https://sites.google.

  abstract: " Identification of textile properties is an important milestone toward advanced robotic manipulation tasks that consider interaction with clothing items such as assisted dressing, laundry folding, automated sewing, textile recycling and reusing. Despite the abundance of work considering this class of deformable objects, many open problems remain. These relate to the choice and modelling of the sensory feedback as well as the control and planning of the interaction and manipulation strategies. Most importantly, there is no structured approach for studying and assessing different approaches that may bridge the gap between the robotics community and textile production industry. To this end, we outline a textile taxonomy considering fiber types and production methods, commonly used in textile industry. We devise datasets according to the taxonomy, and study how robotic actions, such as pulling and twisting of the textile samples, can be used for the classification. We also provide important insights from the perspective of visualization and interpretability of the gathered data."

  abstract: "The tuned liquid dampers (TLD) technology is a feasible and cost-effective seismic design. In order to improve its efficiency it is fundamental to find accurate models describing their dynamic. A TLD system can be modeled through the Housner model and its parameters can be estimated by solving a nonlinear state estimation problem. We propose a robust extended Kalman filter which alleviates the model discretization and the fact that the noise process is not known. We test the effectiveness of the proposed approach by using some experimental data corresponding to two classical seismic waves, namely the El Centro wave and the Hachinohe wave."
